Preface to the First Edition 第一版前言

We first came to focus on what is now known as reinforcement learning in late 1979. We were both
at the University of Massachusetts, working on one of the earliest projects to revive the idea that
networks of neuronlike adaptive elements might prove to be a promising approach to artificial adaptive
intelligence. The project explored the “heterostatic theory of adaptive systems” developed by A. Harry
Klopf. Harry’s work was a rich source of ideas, and we were permitted to explore them critically and
compare them with the long history of prior work in adaptive systems. Our task became one of teasing
the ideas apart and understanding their relationships and relative importance. This continues today,
but in 1979 we came to realize that perhaps the simplest of the ideas, which had long been taken for
granted, had received surprisingly little attention from a computational perspective. This was simply
the idea of a learning system that wants something, that adapts its behavior in order to maximize a
special signal from its environment. This was the idea of a “hedonistic” learning system, or, as we
would say now, the idea of reinforcement learning.

我们最早于1979年底开始聚焦现在所谓的增强学习。当时在马萨诸塞州大学,致力于一项旨在使用类神经适应性单元组成的网络实现人工适应性智能的工作。
